Transfer Learning Approach to Multi-Target QSRR Modeling in RPLC

In this research, we focused on pH variation as a key experimental parameter, with the goal of predicting retention times at various pH levels using QSRR modelling. Within this context, models predicting the retention time of small molecules in reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) at a single pH level are defined as single-target prediction models. In contrast, models capable of predicting retention times across multiple pH levels are classified as multitarget prediction models. The METLIN(SMRT) data set was downloaded from its Figshare repository.24 The retention time of nearly all molecules falls within two distinct
intervals: 0-2 minutes and 8-25 minutes. Molecules with low retention times (Retention time 2 minutes) were excluded from the SMRT dataset, resulting in a total of approximately 77 thousand molecules. The other data sets (RIKEN25,26 and LPAC27), which was our in-house dataset, were used for testing purposes. This study did not generate any data. The LPAC dataset, containing only 96 compounds, poses a data scarcity issue, making it challenging for any advanced QSRR modelling. Therefore, obtaining their retention time requires exploring
approaches such as transfer learning. The SMRT and Riken datasets had only one experimentally observed retention time consequently, we employed it in our study exclusively for single-target prediction modelling.
Conversely, the LPAC datasets offered five retention times to be predicted(at pH 2.0, pH 3.5, pH 5.0, pH 6.5 and pH 8.0) hence, this was used for multitarget modelling as well.
